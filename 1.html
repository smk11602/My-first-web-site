It's been a long time since you're gone<br></a>
Still filled up with the scent of your warmth
Staring at the blank wall
Drawing what's been natural
Gets way more vivid when I'm lost
Just wandering in the crowd
where I'm standing
No matter how much it sways
Listening to the songs
we used to relate
(And I know) Nothing will change
Done counting down the reasons
Honestly, wanting to say
Nobody else would need you to stay
But any chance it might've been
too late, too late
could've been obvious
No time to blame</p>
All I want is having you in my day
<p style="margin-top:20px;">The days are emptier without you
It's just me on my side
But when my arms are around you
There's nothing else to crave
You don't know, you don't know
I want it this way
As the leaves fall down, I wish it not to snow
Dying for it to come
Back in my days, I was uesd to being
all alone
The sky gets ethereal for the things
No longer living in chains
Hours passing by in a minute
Nobody else would need you to stay</P>
