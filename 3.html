<p>Tell me bout your dreaming<br>
I believe I was there too
I could sense your breathing
Lying in a different room
Cuz Laws of the universe
Always there to observe
You shimmer
Your inner compass is taking you there
I'll be your beacon illuminate
while you on your way
Girl I've been there too
Don't be afraid tonight afraid tonight
Just know you never be lonely
I know it's hard sometimes
to see the light
But you and I keep on dreaming
(come on)
We gon' light it up
Light it up now darling
We can make the stars align
We gon' light it up
Light it up now we sparkling
Brighter than the fireflies</P>
